# Index-Programming
##### This program is an exercise in the use of Strings and linked data structures to build a somewhat complex program. This program reads a file (War and Peace in this case) and does the following:
  * Count the number of occurrences of each character in the file. (The entire file)
  * Count the number of total words in the file where a word is classified as any string separated from other words by white space. 
  * Count the number of unique words (case does not matter for this count).
  * Count the number of lines in the file.
  * Output a sorted list of the unique words to an output file called word_count.txt where each word is listed on a line by itself along with its count.
  * Output a sorted list of characters along with their counts in a file called character_count.txt.
  * It display a prompt asking the user what word they would like to search for as well as displaying an initial text message giving the number of lines in the file, total number of words and total number of unique words ignoring case. 
  * After typing a word at the prompt your program will display the line numbers for all of the lines in the file (6 per line in formatted columns) that contain that particular word. 
  * This process continues as long as the user chooses.
